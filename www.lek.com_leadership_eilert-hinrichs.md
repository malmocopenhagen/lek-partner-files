# Eilert Hinrichs

Eilert Hinrichs is a Partner in L.E.K. Consulting’s London office. He has 20 years of consulting experience and is a senior member of L.E.K.’s European Healthcare Services Practice and European Financial Services Practice. In both sectors he has completed a large number of assignments across Europe, working closely with senior management teams in addressing key strategic issues, developing market entry strategies, improving commercial effectiveness, and providing transaction support on both the buy and sell sides.

The impact of the aging population on healthcare systems and the financial services needs of this ‘golden generation’ are key topics that touch many of his assignments, as they pose challenges but also offer significant opportunities for providers in both sectors.

Eilert has profound understanding of the CEE healthcare systems where he advised on all major transactions over the past five years.

Prior to joining L.E.K., Eilert worked in retail banking in Germany. He received a Master’s Degree in Industrial Engineering from the Fridericiana University of Karlsruhe (KIT).  He is married and has two young boys that keep him on his toes outside of work and he likes outdoor activities, including cycling and skiing.
