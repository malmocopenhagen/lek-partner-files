# Philippe Gorge

Philippe Gorge is a Partner at L.E.K. Consulting, working with leading consumer brands and investors across Europe on their most critical strategic and operational challenges.

Philippe brings deep experience across the consumer landscape, with a particular focus on the fast-evolving health, beauty and wellness sectors, including luxury beauty, skincare, dermocosmetics, fragrance, color cosmetics, haircare, VMS, nutraceuticals, collagen, sports nutrition, gut health and longevity-focused products.

As head of our European Health & Beauty Practice, Philippe partners with both corporates and private equity firms to drive growth, innovation and value creation across the category. He advises brands on go-to-market strategy, channel evolution, marketing, pricing and innovation, as well as operational issues such as supply chain, organization design, complexity reduction and route-to-market.

Philippe’s work spans the full ecosystem — from brands to contract manufacturers, ingredient suppliers, formulators, digital and tech providers, and service partners — enabling an end-to-end view of how to win in this category.

With over 100 commercial due diligences completed, Philippe regularly supports investors through the full deal cycle: from investment thesis development and M&A due diligence to post-deal growth acceleration and transformation.

Philippe brings a strong focus on digital and data, whether building digital commerce models, optimizing performance marketing or embedding data-led decision-making across the enterprise.

Above all, Philippe acts as a long-term strategic partner to consumer leaders looking to navigate complexity and scale with purpose — especially in the health, beauty and luxury segments where the pace of change and consumer expectations are highest.
